# EC2 Image Builder Configuration Summary

## Overview
Successfully recreated and optimized an EC2 Image Builder pipeline for Amazon Linux with:
- **Free Tier Optimization**: Uses t3.micro and t2.micro instance types
- **Modern Amazon Linux 2023**: Latest base image with dnf package manager
- **Enhanced Web Application**: Beautiful, responsive web interface
- **SSM Agent**: Pre-installed and configured for remote management
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Built-in service verification and testing

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Free Tier Optimization
- **Instance Types**: Changed to `["t3.micro", "t2.micro"]` for free tier eligibility
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimized for minimal cost while maintaining functionality

### 2. Enhanced Component Configuration
- **Package Manager**: Updated to use `dnf` instead of `yum` for Amazon Linux 2023
- **Service Verification**: Added comprehensive testing of all installed services
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error reporting and validation steps
- **Modern Web Application**: Created a professional, responsive web interface

### 3. Infrastructure Improvements
- **Security Groups**: Added HTTPS support and better descriptions
- **Tagging Strategy**: Comprehensive tagging for resource management
- **Testing Enabled**: Image tests are now enabled with 720-minute timeout
- **Documentation**: Enhanced inline documentation and comments

### 4. Configuration Structure
```
├── main.tf                     # Main infrastructure configuration
├── variables.tf                # All variable definitions
├── outputs.tf                  # Output values for important resources
├── terraform.tfvars            # Variable values (free tier optimized)
├── launch-template.tf          # Optional launch template for instances
├── deploy-imagebuilder.ps1     # PowerShell deployment script
└── README.md                   # Updated documentation
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Using PowerShell Script (Recommended)
```powershell
# Deploy the infrastructure
./deploy-imagebuilder.ps1 -Action deploy

# Check status
./deploy-imagebuilder.ps1 -Action status

# Clean up when done
./deploy-imagebuilder.ps1 -Action destroy
```

### Manual Deployment
```powershell
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review planned changes
terraform plan

# Deploy infrastructure
terraform apply

# View outputs
terraform output
```

## Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Start Image Build**:
   - Go to EC2 Image Builder console
   - Navigate to "Image pipelines"
   - Find "amazon-linux-web-pipeline"
   - Click "Actions" → "Run pipeline"

2. **Monitor Build Progress**:
   - Build typically takes 15-30 minutes
   - Check "Images" section for build status
   - View logs in the console for troubleshooting

3. **Test the Built AMI**:
   - Launch an EC2 instance using the new AMI
   - Use the provided launch template for quick deployment
   - Access the web application at `http://[instance-public-ip]`

## Web Application Features

The built AMI includes a modern web application with:
- **Professional Design**: AWS-inspired styling with responsive layout
- **Server Information**: Displays OS, web server, instance type details
- **Service Status**: Shows installed features and build information
- **Real-time Data**: Build date and system information

## Resource Outputs

Key outputs provided after deployment:
- `image_pipeline_arn`: ARN of the Image Builder pipeline
- `image_recipe_arn`: ARN of the image recipe
- `component_arn`: ARN of the custom component
- `security_group_id`: ID of the security group
- `launch_template_id`: ID of the optional launch template

## Cost Considerations

- **Build Instance**: Free tier eligible (t3.micro/t2.micro)
- **Build Time**: ~15-30 minutes per build
- **Storage**: AMI storage in your account
- **Network**: Standard data transfer rates apply

## Security Features

- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for Image Builder
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive network access rules
- **SSM Agent**: Secure remote management capability
- **Service Testing**: Verification of all components during build

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Failures**: Check CloudWatch logs in Image Builder console
- **Service Issues**: Review component logs for specific service problems
- **Network Issues**: Verify security group and VPC configurations
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure IAM roles have required permissions

This configuration provides a robust, cost-effective solution for building custom Amazon Linux AMIs with a pre-configured web server, optimized for AWS Free Tier usage.
