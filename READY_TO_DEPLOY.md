# ✅ EC2 Image Builder - Ready for Deployment

## Status: READY TO DEPLOY

Your EC2 Image Builder configuration has been successfully recreated and optimized for Amazon Linux free tier usage. All validation checks have passed.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy

Run this command to deploy everything:
```powershell
./deploy-imagebuilder.ps1 -Action deploy
```

Or manually:
```powershell
terraform apply
```

## 📋 What Will Be Created

### Core Image Builder Resources
- ✅ **IAM Roles**: EC2 Image Builder instance and service roles with proper permissions
- ✅ **Security Groups**: HTTP/HTTPS access for build instances and web servers
- ✅ **Image Component**: Updates system, installs SSM agent, installs Apache, creates web app
- ✅ **Image Recipe**: Combines Amazon Linux 2023 with custom components
- ✅ **Infrastructure Config**: Uses free tier instances (t3.micro, t2.micro)
- ✅ **Distribution Config**: Creates AMI with proper tagging
- ✅ **Image Pipeline**: Orchestrates the build process with testing enabled

### Additional Resources
- ✅ **Launch Template**: Ready-to-use template for launching instances
- ✅ **Web Server Security Group**: Allows HTTP and SSH access

## 🎯 After Deployment

1. **Start the Image Build**:
   - Go to EC2 Image Builder console
   - Find "amazon-linux-web-pipeline" 
   - Click "Actions" → "Run pipeline"

2. **Monitor Progress** (15-30 minutes):
   - Watch build status in console
   - Check CloudWatch logs if needed

3. **Launch Test Instance**:
   - Use the created launch template, or
   - Manually launch EC2 with your new AMI
   - Access web app at `http://[instance-ip]`

## 💰 Cost Optimization

- ✅ **Free Tier Eligible**: Uses t3.micro/t2.micro instances
- ✅ **Build Efficiency**: Comprehensive testing to avoid rebuild cycles
- ✅ **Resource Cleanup**: Instance termination after build completion
- ✅ **Minimal Storage**: Optimized AMI size

## 🔧 Configuration Details

- **Base Image**: Amazon Linux 2023 (latest)
- **Instance Types**: t3.micro, t2.micro (free tier)
- **Web Server**: Apache HTTP Server
- **Management**: Amazon SSM Agent
- **Testing**: Enabled with 720-minute timeout
- **Security**: HTTP/HTTPS access, proper IAM permissions

## 📊 Expected Build Output

Your AMI will include:
- 🔄 Latest system updates (using dnf)
- 🛡️ Amazon SSM Agent (configured and running)
- 🌐 Apache web server (auto-start enabled)
- 📱 Modern responsive web application
- ✅ All services verified during build

## 🆘 If Issues Occur

1. **Validation Errors**: Configuration already validated ✅
2. **Build Failures**: Check CloudWatch logs in Image Builder console
3. **Permission Issues**: IAM roles configured with required permissions ✅
4. **Network Issues**: Security groups properly configured ✅
